SCA & Vulnerability Management Lab


## 🚀 Overview

Welcome to my **Software Composition Analysis (SCA) & Vulnerability Management Lab**!  
This hands-on lab demonstrates how to detect, analyze, and remediate vulnerabilities in project dependencies using **GitHub Dependabot**.  

It is designed both as a **practical DevSecOps learning experience** and as a **pedagogical tool** for students and developers aiming to master secure software development practices.

## 🔑 Key Features

- **Automated Vulnerability Detection:** Identify critical issues in open-source libraries.  
- **Dependabot Alerts:** Monitor and manage security risks in real-time.  
- **Automatic Pull Requests:** Efficiently fix vulnerabilities without manual intervention.  
- **Pedagogical Workflow:** Step-by-step guidance for understanding SCA concepts.

## 🛠 Lab Workflow

1. **Create a new repository**  
2. **Validate repository setup**  
3. **Create essential files:**  
   - `package.json`  
   - `index.js`  
   - `dependabot.yml`  
4. **Enable Dependabot alerts:** Go to **Security → Dependabot alerts** and activate required settings.  
5. **Detect vulnerabilities:** Review issues listed in Dependabot alerts.  
6. **Analyze and interpret reports:** Use tools like ChatGPT to summarize findings.  
7. **Remediate vulnerabilities:** Apply fixes and verify results.  
8. **Confirm resolution:** Ensure no critical vulnerabilities remain in Dependabot alerts.
